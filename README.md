# Unpublished Work

Some projects were never published for various reasons. Consider these to be conversation starter and vaporware.

- copy-and-patch js jit; compiler, runtime and patches written in Rust; ran out of steam when I realized how big js language is. If you have a small language that needs jit, talk to me.
- derivatives trading bot, java akka on top of ibkr. IBKR actors are probably worth open sourcing.
